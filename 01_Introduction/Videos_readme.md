### Analysis of Algorithm (Background)
- Actual running time of program is depende upon coomputing power of machine.
- The other factor is programming language.Compiled languages like C and C++ runs faster as compare to Interpreter languages like Java and Python.
- Also system load plays important role in time required for execution of a program. Same program may have different times of execution depending upon system load.
- To compare different codes irrespective of problems mentioned above and any other technical dependent issues, we use asymptotic analysis.
- Asymptotic analysis is thereotically providing time required by algorithm. So we don't even have to actual code the algorithm to check it's time complexity.
