It's important to find efficiency  of algorithm in terms of time and space.

Asymptotic analysis analyzes algorithm based on input size

3 cases:
1. Worst Case:
	- We calculate upper bound on running time of algorithm
2. Average Case:
	- We calculate running time for all types of inputs and average them.
	- It is required that input should be uniformly distributed.
	- It is not easy to calculate average case
3. Best Case:
    - We calculate lower bound on running time of algorithm.
